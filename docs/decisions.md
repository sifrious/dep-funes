## D-001 — Entity references are typed and namespaced

Funes exposes project, identity, repository, organization, and domain as stable `EntityKind`
values. An `EntityReference` combines one kind with a namespaced opaque identifier. It rejects host
database integers and unqualified display names because neither can retain identity across
applications. Funes preserves the identifier without resolving or interpreting its namespace.
